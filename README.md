# Opensesame Experiments

These are copies of experiment files using opensesame: http://osdoc.cogsci.nl, a wonderful open-source experiment builder in psychology. Some of these are from published manuscripts and some are from student projects, but all are provided as templates for replication or other related experiments.

Most of my research involves rating faces on various attributes (e.g., "How attractive is this face"). There are also a few IATs I developed for student research projects which are based on Kapoor (2015): https://figshare.com/articles/Implicit_Association_Test_Template_OpenSesame_/1138676. 

Here is information about the experiment:

face-elections-senate-cogent: this is a face rating task from Franklin & Zebrowitz (2016).

face-elections-house-ridenour: this is a face rating task from Ridenour & Franklin (under review). Participants were presented with pairs of politicians from U.S. House elections and asked to rate them on competence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness.
