# Opensesame Experiments

These are copies of experiment files using [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl), a wonderful open-source experiment builder in psychology. Some of these are from published manuscripts and some are from student projects, but all are provided as templates for replication or other related experiments.

Most of my research involves rating faces on various attributes (e.g., "How attractive is this face"). There are also a few IATs I developed for student research projects which are based on [Kapoor, 2015](https://figshare.com/articles/Implicit_Association_Test_Template_OpenSesame_/1138676). 

Here is information about the experiments:

face-elections-senate-cogent: this is a face rating task from Franklin & Zebrowitz (2016). In this task, participants were presented with pairs of candidates for US Senate elections and asked to make a choice which candidate was more competent, trustworthy, attractive, or babyfaced. After making the choice, participants were asked to rate "how much more competent" was the chosen candidate than the candidate who was not chosen on a 7 point scale. More details are available [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23311908.2016.1151602).

face-elections-house-ridenour: this is a face rating task from Ridenour & Franklin (under review). Participants were presented with pairs of politicians from U.S. House elections and asked to rate them on competence, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The protocol is similar to Franklin & Zebrowitz (2016).

face-traitrating-EAR: This is a complex rating task used in Franklin & Zebrowitz (in press), where older and younger adults rated faces on how much they appeared to show various adjectives. Participants were presented with a face and four 7-point rating scales and asked to rate how happy, angry, sad, and fearful the face appeared to be. Faces varied in their emotion and their intensity.

flanker-word-face: this is a simple flanker task looking at how faces affect responses for words. Faces of various genders are presented in the periphery as words are shown in the middle. This was part of a undergraduate class project to see if the gender of the face affected how quickly someone responded to words stereotypically associated with women or men.

IAT: these IATs are from student projects to look at a basic race IAT examining the association between Black and White faces with good and bad adjectives and the association between mental health and physical health words with good and bad adjectives. They are abbreviated from the traditional IAT and the data output is very messy.
